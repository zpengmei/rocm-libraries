# Changelog for rocFFT

Documentation for rocFFT is available at
[https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocFFT/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocFFT/en/latest/).

## Since last release (ROCm 7.13)

### Added
* Generalized multi-device computations for transforms such that each of the length dimension is fully covered either in all the input field's bricks or in all the output field's bricks, regardless of the type and placement of the transform. Note specifically for real transforms: the innermost length dimension must be fully covered in all the input (resp. output) field's bricks for real forward (resp. inverse) transforms.

### Changed

* Modified the `rocfft_plan_get_work_buffer_size` and `rocfft_execution_info_set_work_buffer` functions to get and set work memory for the current HIP device.
  * Multi-device transforms can require work memory on any of the devices used for input or output bricks, and the current device set at plan creation.  Users should loop over the set of devices used by the input/output of the transform and check the work memory requirements for each device.


## rocFFT 1.0.37 for ROCm 7.13

### Optimized

* Allow plans to share hipModules if they use the same kernels.  This reduces time spent and memory used when
  creating plans that exist concurrently.
* Improved performance of unit-strided, interleaved, complex-to-complex and real-to-complex FFTs on gfx1201, gfx90a, gfx942, and gfx950.
  Single-precision lengths:
  * (160,72,72)
  * (160,80,72)
  * (160,80,80)
  * (72,72,72)
  * (80,80,80)
  * (84,84,72)
  * (96,96,96)
  * (108,108,80)
  Double-precision lengths:
  * (72,72,52)
  * (60,60,60)
  * (64,64,52)
  * (64,64,64)

### Changed

* Moved library to C++20 standard.
* Removed Boost as a dependency for clients and samples.
* Split the precompiled kernel cache file (`rocfft_kernel_cache.db`) into per-architecture files (`rocfft_kernel_cache_gfx950.db`, `rocfft_kernel_cache_gfx1201.db`, etc).
* `rocfft_plan_create` returns `rocfft_status_invalid_offset` for any usage of non-zero offsets in plan descriptions. The feature is not supported yet.
* Callback functions will be deprecated in a future release.

### Resolved issues

* Fixed potential issue with data generation for multidimensional transforms in rocfft-tests and rocfft-bench.
* Fixed issue that sometimes blocked complex-to-complex FFT plan creation when using noncontiguous strides in multiple dimensions.
* Fixed issue that sometimes blocked complex-to-real FFT plan creation when using noncontiguous strides in multiple dimensions.
* Fixed issue that sometimes blocked complex-to-real FFT plan creation when using noncontiguous strides with small lengths on the two fastest dimensions.
* Fixed potential launch failure of data generation kernels in test and benchmark programs.
* Fixed incorrect results on some strided real-complex FFTs on gfx90a.
* Fixed incorrect results on some even-length real FFTs that have odd-length strides on higher dimensions.
* Fixed callbacks on MPI transforms, when not all ranks have the same number of data bricks.
* Fixed functional issues for multi-device, in-place real transforms.
* Fixed functional issues for multi-dimensional, multi-device transforms involving some unit length(s).
* Fixed functional issues for multi-device transforms involving data divisions along the slowest-varying axis (only) for some bricks but not all.
* Fixed functional issues for multi-device transforms setting no field on input or output.
* Fixed automatic allocation of work memory at plan execution time, when work memory is required on multiple devices.

## rocFFT 1.0.36 for ROCm 7.2.0

### Added

* Support for gfx1150 architecture.
* Added support for per precision and architecture kernel configuration entries in the library.
* Support for the gfx1152 and gfx1153 architectures.

### Optimized

* Removed a potential unnecessary global transpose operation from MPI 3D multi-GPU pencil decompositions.
* Enabled optimization of 3D pencil decompositions for single-process multi-GPU transforms.

### Resolved issues

* Fixed potential division by zero when constructing plans using dimensions of length 1.
* Fixed result scaling on multi-device transforms.
* Fixed callbacks on multi-device transforms.

## rocFFT 1.0.35 for ROCM 7.1.0

### Optimized

* Implemented single-kernel plans for some 2D problem sizes, on devices with at least 160KiB of LDS.
* Improved performance of unit-strided, complex-interleaved, forward/inverse FFTs for lengths:
  * (64,64,128)
  * (64,64,52)
  * (60,60,60)
  * (32,32,128)
  * (32,32,64)
  * (64,32,128)
* Improved performance of 3D MPI pencil decompositions by using sub-communicators for global transpose operations.

## rocFFT 1.0.34 for ROCm 7.0.0

### Added

* Added gfx950 support.

### Removed

* Removed rocfft-rider legacy compatibility from clients
* Removed support for the gfx940 and gfx941 targets from the client programs.

### Optimized

* Removed unnecessary HIP event/stream allocation and synchronization during MPI transforms.
* Implemented single-precision 1D kernels for lengths:
  * 4704
  * 5488
  * 6144
  * 6561
  * 8192
* Implemented single-kernel plans for some large 1D problem sizes, on devices with at least 160KiB of LDS.

### Resolved issues

* Fixed kernel faults on multi-device transforms that gather to a single device, when the input/output bricks are not
  contiguous.

## rocFFT 1.0.32 for ROCm 6.4.0

### Changed

* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ on relevant GPU
  architectures and adds address-sanitizer support to runtime-compiled
  kernels.
* The `AMDGPU_TARGETS` build variable should be replaced with `GPU_TARGETS`. `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is deprecated.

### Removed

* Removed ahead-of-time compiled kernels for the gfx906, gfx940, and gfx941 architectures. These architectures still
  function the same, but kernels for them are now compiled at runtime.
* Removed consumer GPU architectures from the precompiled kernel cache that ships with
  rocFFT. rocFFT continues to ship with a cache of precompiled RTC kernels for data-center
  and workstation architectures. As before, user-level caches can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH to a writeable file location.

### Optimized

* Improved MPI transform performance by using all-to-all communication for global transpose operations.  
  Point-to-point communications are still used when all-to-all is not possible.
* Improved the performance of unit-strided, complex interleaved, forward and inverse, length (64,64,64) FFTs.

### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results from 2-kernel 3D FFT plans that used non-default output strides. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/507).
* Plan descriptions can be reused with different strides for different plans. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/504).
* Fixed client packages to depend on hipRAND instead of rocRAND.
* Fixed potential integer overflows during large MPI transforms.

## rocFFT 1.0.31 for ROCm 6.3.0

### Added

* rocfft-test now includes a --smoketest option.
* Support for the gfx1151, gfx1200, and gfx1201 architectures.
* Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data
  distributed across multiple MPI ranks. These APIs can be enabled with the
  `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option. This option defaults to `OFF`.

  When `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` is set to `ON`:

  * `rocfft_plan_description_set_comm` can be called to provide an
    MPI communicator to a plan description, which can then be passed
    to `rocfft_plan_create`. Each rank calls
    `rocfft_field_add_brick` to specify the layout of data bricks on
    that rank.

  * An MPI library with ROCm acceleration enabled is required at
    build time and at runtime.

### Changed

* Compilation uses amdclang++ instead of hipcc.
* CLI11 replaces Boost Program Options as the command line parser for clients and samples.

## rocFFT 1.0.30 for ROCm 6.2.4

### Optimizations

* Implemented 1D kernels for factorizable sizes > 1024 and < 2048.

### Fixes

* Fixed plan creation failure on some even-length real-complex transforms that use Bluestein's algorithm.

### Additions

* GFX1151 Support

## rocFFT 1.0.29 for ROCm 6.2.1

### Optimizations

* Implemented 1D kernels for factorizable sizes < 1024

## rocFFT 1.0.28 for ROCm 6.2.0

### Optimizations

* Implemented multi-device transform for 3D pencil decomposition.  Contiguous dimensions on input and output bricks
  are transformed locally, with global transposes to make remaining dimensions contiguous.

### Changes

* Add option in dyna-bench to load the libs in forward and then reverse order for benchmark tests.
* Randomly generated accuracy tests are now disabled by default; these can be enabled using
  the --nrand <int> option (which defaults to 0).
* Use Bonferroni multi-hypothesis testing framework by default for benchmark tests.

## rocFFT 1.0.27 for ROCm 6.1.1

### Fixes

* Fixed kernel launch failure on execute of very large odd-length real-complex transforms.

### Additions

* Enable multi-gpu testing on systems without direct GPU-interconnects

## rocFFT 1.0.26 for ROCm 6.1.0

### Changes

* Multi-device FFTs now allow batch greater than 1
* Multi-device, real-complex FFTs are now supported
* rocFFT now statically links libstdc++ when only `std::experimental::filesystem` is available (to guard
  against ABI incompatibilities with newer libstdc++ libraries that include `std::filesystem`)

## rocFFT 1.0.25 for ROCm 6.0.0

### Additions

* Implemented experimental APIs to allow computing FFTs on data distributed across multiple devices
  in a single process

  * `rocfft_field` is a new type that can be added to a plan description to describe the layout of FFT
    input or output
  * `rocfft_field_add_brick` can be called to describe the brick decomposition of an FFT field, where each
    brick can be assigned a different device

  These interfaces are still experimental and subject to change. We are interested in getting feedback.
  You can raise questions and concerns by opening issues in the
  [rocFFT issue tracker](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues).

  Note that multi-device FFTs currently have several limitations (we plan to address these in future
  releases):

  * Real-complex (forward or inverse) FFTs are not supported
  * Planar format fields are not supported
  * Batch (the `number_of_transforms` provided to `rocfft_plan_create`) must be 1
  * FFT input is gathered to the current device at run time, so all FFT data must fit on that device

### Optimizations

* Improved the performance of several 2D/3D real FFTs supported by `2D_SINGLE` kernel. Offline
  tuning provides more optimization for fx90a
* Removed an extra kernel launch from even-length, real-complex FFTs that use callbacks

### Changes

* Built kernels in a solution map to the library kernel cache
* Real forward transforms (real-to-complex) no longer overwrite input; rocFFT may still overwrite real
  inverse (complex-to-real) input, as this allows for faster performance

* `rocfft-rider` and `dyna-rocfft-rider` have been renamed to `rocfft-bench` and `dyna-rocfft-bench`;
  these are controlled by the `BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCH` CMake option
  * Links for the former file names are installed, and the former `BUILD_CLIENTS_RIDER` CMake option
    is accepted for compatibility, but both will be removed in a future release
* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix

### Fixes

* rocFFT now correctly handles load callbacks that convert data from a smaller data type (e.g., 16-bit
  integers -> 32-bit float)

## rocFFT 1.0.24 for ROCm 5.7.0

### Optimizations

* Improved the performance of complex forward/inverse 1D FFTs (2049 <= length <= 131071) that use
  Bluestein's algorithm

### Additions

* Implemented a solution map version converter and finished the first conversion from ver.0 to ver.1
  * Version 1 removes some incorrect kernels (sbrc/sbcr using `half_lds`)

### Changes

* Moved `rocfft_rtc_helper` executable to the `lib/rocFFT` directory on Linux
* Moved library kernel cache to the `lib/rocFFT` directory

## rocFFT 1.0.23 for ROCm 5.6.0

### Additions

* Implemented half-precision transforms; these can be requested by passing `rocfft_precision_half` to
  `rocfft_plan_create`
* Implemented a hierarchical solution map that saves information on how to decompose a problem
  and the kernels that are used
* Implemented a first version of offline-tuner to support tuning kernels for C2C and Z2Z problems

### Changes

* Replaced `std::complex` with hipComplex data types for the data generator
* FFT plan dimensions are now sorted to be row-major internally where possible, which produces
  better plans if the dimensions were accidentally specified in a different order (column-major, for
  example)
* Added the `--precision` argument to benchmark and test clients (`--double` is still accepted but is
  deprecated as a method to request a double-precision transform)
* Improved performance test suite statistical framework

### Fixes

* Fixed over-allocation of LDS in some real-complex kernels, which was resulting in kernel launch
  failure

## rocFFT 1.0.22 for ROCm 5.5.0

### Optimizations

* Moved transpose, real-complex, Bluestein, and Stockham kernels to the library kernel cache

### Fixes

* Removed zero-length twiddle table allocations, which fixes errors from `hipMallocManaged`
* Fixed incorrect freeing of HIP stream handles during twiddle computation when multiple devices are
  present

## rocFFT 1.0.21 for ROCm 5.4.3

### Fixes

  unintended location

## rocFFT 1.0.20 for ROCm 5.4.1

### Fixes

* Fixed incorrect results on strided large 1D FFTs where batch size does not equal the stride

## rocFFT 1.0.19 for ROCm 5.4.0

### Optimizations

* Optimized some strided large 1D plans

### Additions

* Added the `rocfft_plan_description_set_scale_factor` API to efficiently multiply each output element of
  an FFT by a given scaling factor
* Created a `rocfft_kernel_cache.db` file next to the installed library; SBCC, CR, and RC kernels are
  moved to this file when built with the library, and are runtime-compiled for new GPU architectures
* Added gfx1100 and gfx1102 to default `AMDGPU_TARGETS`

### Changes

* Moved the runtime compilation cache to in-memory by default
  * A default on-disk cache can encounter contention problems on multi-node clusters with a shared
    filesystem
  * rocFFT can still use an on-disk cache by setting the `ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH` environment
    variable

## rocFFT 1.0.18 for ROCm 5.3.0

### Changes

* The runtime compilation cache now looks for environment variables `XDG_CACHE_HOME` (on Linux)
  and `LOCALAPPDATA` (on Windows) before falling back to `HOME`
* Moved computation of the twiddle table from the host to the device

### Optimizations

* Optimized 2D R2C and C2R to use 2-kernel plans where possible
* Improved performance of the Bluestein algorithm
* Optimized sbcc-168 and 100 by using half-LDS
* Optimized length-280 2D and 3D transforms
* Added kernels for factorizable 1D lengths < 128

### Fixes

* Fixed occasional failures to parallelize runtime compilation of kernels (failures would be retried
  serially and ultimately succeed, but this would take extra time)
* Fixed failures of some R2C 3D transforms that use the unsupported `TILE_UNALGNED` SBRC kernels
  (an example is 98^3 R2C out-of-place)
* Fixed bugs in the `SBRC_ERC` type

## rocFFT 1.0.17 for ROCm 5.2.0

### Additions

* Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported operating systems using CPack
* Added file and folder reorganization changes, with backward compatibility support, using
  `rocm-cmake` wrapper functions

### Changes

* Added padding to work buffer sizes to improve performance in many cases

### Fixes

  [hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipFFT) package or repository to obtain the API

## rocFFT 1.0.15 for ROCm 5.0.0

### Changes

* Enabled runtime compilation of single FFT kernels > length 1024
* Re-aligned the split device library into four roughly equal libraries
* Implemented the FuseShim framework to replace the original OptimizePlan
* Implemented the generic buffer-assignment framework
  * The buffer assignment is no longer performed by each node--we designed a generic algorithm to
    test and pick the best assignment path
  * With the help of FuseShim, we can achieve the most kernel-fusions possible
* Don't read the imaginary part of the DC and Nyquist modes for even-length complex-to-real
  transforms

## rocFFT 1.0.14 for ROCm 4.5.0

### Optimizations

* Optimized SBCC kernels of lengths 52, 60, 72, 80, 84, 96, 104, 108, 112, 160, 168, 208, 216, 224, and
  240 with a new kernel generator

### Additions

* Added support for Windows 10 as a build target

### Changes

* Packaging has been split into a runtime package (`rocfft`) and a development package
  (`rocfft-devel`):
  The development package depends on the runtime package. When installing the runtime package,
  the package manager will suggest the installation of the development package to aid users
  transitioning from the previous version's combined package. This suggestion by package manager is
  for all supported operating systems (except CentOS 7) to aid in the transition. The `suggestion`
  feature in the runtime package is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future
  ROCm release.

### Fixes

* Fixed validation failures for even-length R2C inplace 2D and 3D cubics sizes, such as 100^2 (or ^3),
  200^2 (or ^3), and 256^2 (or ^3)
  * We combine two kernels (`r2c-transpose`) instead of combining the three kernels
    (`stockham-r2c-transpose`)

### Changes

* Split 2D device code into separate libraries

## rocFFT 1.0.13 for ROCm 4.4.0

### Optimizations

* Improved plans by removing unnecessary transpose steps
* Optimized scheme selection for 3D problems
  * Imposed fewer restrictions on `3D_BLOCK_RC` selection (more problems can use `3D_BLOCK_RC` and
    have performance gains)
  * Enabled `3D_RC`; some 3D problems with SBCC-supported z-dim can use fewer kernels to get
    benefits
  * Forced `--length` 336 336 56 (dp) to use faster `3D_RC` to prevent it from being skipped by a
    conservative threshold test
* Optimized some even-length R2C/C2R cases by doing more in-place operations and combining
  pre- and post-processing into Stockham kernels
* Added radix-17

### Additions

  API functions to allow running extra logic when loading data from and storing data to global
  memory during a transform

  ([issue 311](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues/311))
* Fixed potential crashes when running transforms on multiple devices
  ([issue 310](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocFFT/issues/310))
