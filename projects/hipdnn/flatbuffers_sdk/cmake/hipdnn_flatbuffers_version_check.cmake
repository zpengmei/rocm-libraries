# Shared FlatBuffers version validation, used by both the in-tree
# flatbuffers_sdk/CMakeLists.txt at build time and by the installed
# hipdnn_flatbuffers_sdkConfig.cmake package config at consumer
# find_package() time. Single-sourcing the comparison and core message keeps
# the two call sites from drifting.
#
# Usage:
#   hipdnn_check_flatbuffers_version(
#       EXPECTED  <version>           # the version hipDNN was/is built against
#       CONTEXT   <human-readable>    # "hipDNN" or "hipDNN Flatbuffers SDK"
#       [DETAIL   <suffix>]           # optional extra remediation text
#   )
#
# Reads the ambient flatbuffers_VERSION / flatbuffers_FOUND set by the most
# recent find_package(flatbuffers). Emits FATAL_ERROR on mismatch, a WARNING
# when the package config didn't populate flatbuffers_VERSION, and is silent
# otherwise (including the FetchContent path where flatbuffers_FOUND is unset).
