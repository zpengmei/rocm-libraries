# hipDNN Review

Review hipDNN changes with a code-review stance. Lead with findings, ordered by severity, and ground each finding in file and line references. Prioritize correctness, compatibility, resource ownership, provider behavior, test quality, and maintainability over style-only comments.

## Inputs

Infer the review target from the user request:

- **Pull request URL**: review a GitHub pull request.
- **Local diff**: review the current worktree changes.
- **Branch name**: review a local or remote branch.
- **Base branch**: default to the pull request base, then `origin/develop`, then `develop`.
- **Focus area**: optional emphasis such as `testing`, `backend`, `frontend`, `provider`, `build`, or `reuse`.
- **Diff-only**: use only when the user explicitly wants to avoid local checkout or worktree setup.

Ask the user which change set to review if it cannot be inferred.

## Setup

1. Determine the repository root:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

2. Inspect changed files:
   - Pull request:
     ```bash
     gh pr view <pr-url> --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,changedFiles,baseRefName,headRefName
     gh pr diff <pr-url> --name-only
     ```
   - Local diff:
     ```bash
     git diff --name-only <base>...
     git diff --stat <base>...
     ```
   - Branch:
     ```bash
     git diff --name-only <base>...<branch-ref>
     git diff --stat <base>...<branch-ref>
     ```

3. Save the full diff to a file instead of pasting it into the conversation:
   ```bash
   DIFF_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/review.XXXXXX.diff")
   ```
   Use repository or workspace artifact directories when active instructions require them.

4. Prefer local source for cross-reference. A review based only on a web page or raw diff has lower confidence unless the user requested diff-only mode.

5. Read only the files needed to validate the changed behavior and nearby patterns. Prefer `rg` for call sites, similar implementations, tests, and ownership patterns; fall back to `grep` if needed.

Do not modify files during review.

## Scope Buckets

Classify changed files before reviewing:

- **Frontend**: `projects/hipdnn/frontend/`, `projects/hipdnn/python/`, public frontend headers, graph/node/attribute wrappers, public C++ or Python API.
- **Backend**: `projects/hipdnn/backend/`, descriptors, engines, plugin loading, pack/unpack logic, backend C API.
- **Data and FlatBuffers SDK**: `projects/hipdnn/data_sdk/`, `projects/hipdnn/flatbuffers_sdk/`, `.fbs` schemas, generated-object wrappers.
- **Plugin SDK**: `projects/hipdnn/plugin_sdk/`, plugin interfaces, ABI/API contracts, behavior notes.
- **Providers**: `dnn-providers/`, provider registration, applicability, execution, workspace, external library calls.
- **Build and infrastructure**: `CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/`, `CMakePresets.json`, CI, packaging, scripts.
- **Tests**: unit/integration tests, test SDK helpers, GTest fixtures, generated test data.
- **Docs and tools**: documentation, RFCs, codegen, developer tooling.

## Review Checklist

### Correctness

- Validate the changed code path end to end, not just changed lines.
- Check new branches, status returns, enum conversions, descriptor fields, and default values.
- Confirm error paths return meaningful hipDNN status codes and do not leave partially initialized state.
- For public API changes, verify naming, lifetime rules, nullability, and consistency with existing API style.
- For schemas or serialized data, check backward/forward compatibility, defaults, and generated wrapper behavior.

### Resource Ownership

hipDNN CI commonly runs sanitizer-enabled tests. Treat leaks and ownership ambiguity as substantive review issues.

- Owning raw pointers must be wrapped in RAII immediately.
- FlatBuffers `UnPack()` returns owning raw pointers; prefer generated helpers returning `std::unique_ptr`, or wrap manually.
- Backend descriptor attributes that allocate descriptors must transfer ownership clearly and be wrapped immediately by callers.
- Avoid manual `delete`; it is fragile with assertions, exceptions, and early returns.
- Check provider handles, workspace buffers, streams, and library resources for correct lifetime and failure cleanup.

### Provider Behavior

- Verify provider applicability predicates match the implementation's actual support.
- Confirm registration uses the correct operation type, tensor layouts, data types, compute types, and behavior notes.
- Check workspace size calculation, stream usage, async behavior, and external library API calls.
- Ensure unsupported cases fail predictably instead of dispatching to an invalid or partial implementation.

### Compatibility Claims

- For hipDNN APIs corresponding to cuDNN APIs, compare signature, parameter semantics, defaults, status behavior, ownership/lifetime rules, and documented constraints.
- Prefer source-level comparison against the public cuDNN frontend repository when available. Use NVIDIA's published cuDNN API documentation as supporting reference for released behavior.
- If no authoritative source can be located, flag the compatibility point for human verification rather than relying on memory.
- Flag public API changes that silently diverge from equivalent cuDNN behavior unless the divergence is explicit, documented, and intentional.

### Code Reuse

- Search for existing helpers before recommending or accepting duplicated logic.
- Flag copy-paste implementations when an existing descriptor, wrapper, validator, test fixture, or provider helper can be reused.
- Recommend new abstractions only when duplication is meaningful and the abstraction matches existing project patterns.

### Build and Packaging

- Check CMake target visibility, component boundaries, install/export behavior, and generated-file dependencies.
- Avoid hardcoded local paths, machine-specific assumptions, and build-order dependencies.
- For CI or script changes, verify the command shape matches the repository's supported Linux and Windows workflows.

## Testing Review

Testing review is required for every hipDNN review, even when no test files changed. Do not equate "tests were added" with "behavior is covered"; read assertions and map them to changed code paths.

For documentation-only, AI-skill-only, or comment-only changes with no product behavior, focus on validation appropriate to the artifact, such as metadata parsing, link/installability, or dry-run invocation.

Assess:

- Covered behavior: meaningful coverage that exists.
- Missing coverage: exact scenarios or code paths that need tests.
- Weak tests: shallow assertions, excessive mocking, nondeterminism, or poor isolation.
- Recommended tests: concrete test names or scenarios to add.

### ASIC / Multi-Arch Coverage

Every review must judge whether the PR's test coverage spans the GPU architectures (ASICs) the change can affect. Decide the required coverage from the diff content, not the file path, then compare it against what the PR actually tested and claimed.

Classify the change's blast radius:

- ASIC-independent wiring, plumbing, or core capability that does not change kernel selection, support surface, or default behavior: passing PR CI is sufficient.
- Frontend or default-setting changes, or dispatch-behavior changes, that existing test cases exercise: a multi-arch CI run is warranted, since the change can shift existing test-case behavior per architecture.
- Provider changes adding or extending ops or support surface: a full multi-arch sweep is warranted, unless the ops are scoped to specific architectures, in which case only those.
- Arch-specific changes (for example, a gfx950-only kernel or code path): only the affected ASICs.
- Expanding or newly enabling generic integration test cases (for example, activating a suite in a provider lane): a full sweep across all supported GFX families is warranted — not just the default CI test families — since a newly added or activated generic case can fail on any target.
- Docs-only, comments-only, or skill-only changes: no ASIC coverage needed.

Then reconcile against the PR:

- Read the PR body's `## ASIC Coverage` section (the one the PR summary produces) and its testing checklist. Flag when it is absent for a change that has ASIC impact.
- Flag when the claimed or completed coverage is narrower than the content warrants — for example, a generic integration test added but only one ASIC tested, or a provider op added with no sweep run.
- Flag when a change is described as targeting a specific ASIC but that ASIC was not tested.
- Flag a behavior-shifting change (defaults or dispatch) that has no covering tests: it needs both new tests and the corresponding multi-arch run; absent coverage is a gap, not an exemption from the run.
- Do not over-escalate: an ASIC-independent change fully covered by passing PR CI does not need a sweep, and saying so is a valid outcome.

Discover the supported architectures and test labels rather than assuming a fixed list; they drift. The GPU families and labels are discoverable from the in-repo multi-arch CI workflow (`.github/workflows/therock-multi-arch-ci.yml`, with `workflow_dispatch` inputs `linux_amdgpu_families` and `linux_test_labels`) and TheRock's GPU-family matrix. The workflow's default `linux_amdgpu_families` is a routine-CI subset, and a family may build but skip tests when its runner is disabled for capacity; when the content requires a full sweep, judge against the supported family matrix, not that default, and treat a build-only-but-untested architecture as uncovered. Names like `gfx90a`, `gfx942`, `gfx950` (specific architectures) and `gfx94X`, `gfx120X` (family-group keys covering multiple architectures) are illustrative only.

When coverage is insufficient, flag the gap as a testing finding and note that the missing coverage can be obtained by launching a TheRock multi-arch integration CI run on the required architectures, so the recommendation is actionable.

## Delegation

When the active host and user request permit reviewer delegation, split broad reviews by affected scope bucket and add cross-cutting testing and reuse reviews. If delegation is unavailable, disallowed, or unnecessary, perform a direct single-pass review using the same checklist.

## Severity

- **Critical**: likely correctness failure, data corruption, leak/crash in normal use, ABI/API break, an untested broad-blast-radius change to a default or shipping path that could silently break an architecture, or a defect serious enough to block merge.
- **Major**: real behavioral risk, missing essential validation, meaningful test gap, missing required ASIC or multi-arch coverage that the change's content warrants, compatibility issue, or maintainability issue likely to cause defects.
- **Minor**: localized quality issue, unclear docs, low-risk edge case, or non-blocking cleanup.
- **Suggestion**: optional improvement, refactor, or broader follow-up.
