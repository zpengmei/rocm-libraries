***************************************
Build and install hipSPARSE for Windows
***************************************

For information on installing and building hipSPARSE on Linux, see :doc:`hipSPARSE for Linux <./build-linux>`.

To build hipSPARSE as part of the ROCm Core SDK, see `TheRock build
instructions
<https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/development/README.md>`__.
TheRock is the recommended way to build ROCm components from source.

Alternatively, you can build hipSPARSE standalone using the following
instructions.

Prerequisites
=============

hipSPARSE requires a :doc:`ROCm-enabled platform <compatibility/compatibility-matrix>`.

Building hipSPARSE from source
=================================

It isn't necessary to build hipSPARSE from source because it's ready to use after installing
the prebuilt packages, as described in :doc:`Install hipSPARSE <./install>`.
To build hipSPARSE from source, follow the instructions in this section.

Requirements
------------

To compile and run hipSPARSE, the `AMD ROCm Platform <https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm>`_ is required.
Building hipSPARSE from source also requires the following components and dependencies:

*  `rocSPARSE <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/rocsparse>`_
*  `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
*  `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (Version 3.5 or later)
*  `vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git>`_
*  `GoogleTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_ (Optional: only required to build the clients)
*  `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
*  `PyYAML <https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/>`_

When building hipSPARSE from source, select a supported version of the :doc:`rocSPARSE <rocsparse:index>` library
dependency. Given a specific version of hipSPARSE,
it's best to use the same version of rocSPARSE.

Downloading hipSPARSE
----------------------

The hipSPARSE source code for Windows, which is the same as for Linux, is available
from the `hipSPARSE folder <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/projects/hipsparse>`_
of the `rocm-libraries GitHub <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries>`_.
The ROCm HIP SDK version might be shown in the default installation path, but
you can run the HIP SDK compiler from the ``bin/`` folder to display the version using this command:

.. code-block:: shell

   hipcc --version

The HIP version number consists of major, minor, and patch fields, and is sometimes followed by a build-specific identifier.
For example, the HIP version might be ``6.4.22880-135e1ab4``.
This corresponds to major release ``6``, minor release ``4``, patch ``22880``, and build identifier ``135e1ab4``.
The rocm-libraries GitHub includes branches with names like ``release/rocm-rel-major.minor``,
where major and minor have the same meaning as the HIP version.

To limit your local checkout to only the hipSPARSE project, configure ``sparse-checkout`` before cloning.
This uses the Git partial clone feature (``--filter=blob:none``) to reduce the data download.
Use the following commands for a sparse checkout:

.. note::

   To include the rocSPARSE dependency, set the projects for the sparse checkout using
   ``git sparse-checkout set projects/hipsparse projects/rocsparse``.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone --no-checkout --filter=blob:none https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries.git
   cd rocm-libraries
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set projects/hipsparse # add projects/rocsparse to include dependency
   git checkout release/rocm-rel-x.y  # or use the branch you want to work with

Replace ``x.y`` in the above command with the version of HIP SDK installed on your machine.
For example, if you have HIP 7.0 installed, use ``-b release/rocm-rel-7.0``.

To download all projects in rocm-libraries, use these commands. This process takes
longer but is recommended for those working with a large number of libraries.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone -b release/rocm-rel-x.y https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries.git
   cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipsparse

.. note::

   To build ROCm 6.4.3 and earlier, use the hipSPARSE repository at `<https://github.com/ROCm/hipSPARSE>`_.
   For more information, see the documentation associated with the release you want to build.

Add the SDK tools to your path with an entry like the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   %HIP_PATH%\bin

Building using the Python script
---------------------------------

This section describes the steps required to build hipSPARSE using the ``rmake.py`` script. You can build:

*  The library
*  The library and client

To call hipSPARSE from your code, you only need the library. The client contains testing and benchmark tools.
``rmake.py`` prints the full ``cmake`` command being used to configure hipSPARSE based on the ``rmake`` command line options.
This full ``cmake`` command can be used in your own build scripts to bypass the Python helper script for a fixed set of build options.

Building the library from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table lists the common ways to use ``rmake.py`` to build the hipSPARSE library only.

.. note::

   You can run ``rmake.py`` from the ``projects\hipsparse`` directory.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command","Description"
   :widths: 40, 90

   "``./rmake.py -h``","Print the help information."
   "``./rmake.py``","Build the library."
   "``./rmake.py -i``","Build the library, then build and install the hipSPARSE package. To keep hipSPARSE in your local tree, do not use the ``-i`` flag."
   "``./rmake.py -in``","Build the library without rocBLAS, then build and install the hipSPARSE package. To keep hipSPARSE in your local tree, do not use the ``-i`` flag."
   "``./rmake.py -i -a gfx900``","Build the library using only the gfx900 architecture, then build and install the hipSPARSE package. To keep hipSPARSE in your local tree, do not use the ``-i`` flag."

Building the library and client from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table lists the common ways to use ``rmake.py`` to build the hipSPARSE library and clients.
