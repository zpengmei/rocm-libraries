# Expected-type derivation for solution parameters --------------------------

# is the source of truth for "what types this parameter is allowed to take".
# Consumers (Solution.validateParameterTypes, and the input-YAML strict gate
# in checkParametersAreValid) import them from this module. Keeping the
# registry and its derived expected-types map co-located preserves the
# Common -> Solution import direction; the prior layout (defined inside
# Solution.py and imported back by ValidParameters extensions) would have
# introduced a Common -> Solution reverse import.
