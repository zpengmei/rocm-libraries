# Tensilelite

## Building and Running Tests

While full test suites can be run with a single `tox` command, developers may wish to
build the hipBLASLt tensilelite client executable (`tensilelite-client`) and run individual tests separately.
This is useful for debugging specific problems or isolating issues in a specific test.

### Run Test Suite with Tox

The standard workflow for running the entire test suite is to use `tox`. This command will build
`tensilelite-client` and execute all tests.

```
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite
tox -e py3 -- Tensile/Tests -m common
```

Subsequently, you can run just the Tensile unit tests via:

```
tox -e unit -- Tensile/Tests/unit
```

### Generate coverage report with Tox

```
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite
tox -e coverage
```

This will:
- Run all unit tests with coverage
- Run all common tests with coverage
- Generate HTML, XML, and JSON reports
- Display a summary in the terminal

```
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite
tox -e coverage-unit
```

Runs only Python unit tests.

### Build client with invoke and Run a Test (Default Path)

This workflow uses `invoke` to build the C++ client into the default `build_tmp` directory.
Tensile will search for `tensilelite-client` in `tensilelite/build_tmp` if `--prebuilt-client`
is not specified.

```
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite

# install invoke if you haven't already
pip3 install invoke

# install rocisa as an editable package (once after cloning, or after pyproject.toml changes)
invoke rocisa

# build the C++ client to the default location
invoke build-client

# override the default toolchain with a specific ROCm install
invoke build-client \
  --gpu-targets gfx950 \
  --rocm-path /opt/rocm-7.3.0 \
  --export-compile-commands

# run an individual test directly — no wrapper script needed
Tensile/bin/Tensile Tensile/Tests/common/exception/<test>.yaml tensile-out
```

### Rebuilding after C++ changes

`invoke build-client` builds the tensilelite-client executable only — it does
**not** rebuild the rocisa Python module (`_rocisa.so`).  If you edit rocisa or
stinkytofu C++ sources you must re-run `invoke rocisa` for those changes to
take effect in Python:

| What you changed | Command to rebuild |
|---|---|
| rocisa C++ sources | `invoke rocisa` |
| stinkytofu C++ sources | `invoke rocisa` |
| tensilelite-client C++ sources | `invoke build-client` |
| rocisa `pyproject.toml` or `CMakeLists.txt` | `invoke rocisa` |

Example workflow after editing stinkytofu or rocisa code:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the rocisa Python module (includes stinkytofu)
invoke rocisa

# 2. Rebuild the C++ client (if needed)
invoke build-client
```

If you forget to rebuild, importing rocisa will raise an `ImportError` listing
the stale source files:

```
ImportError: rocisa C++ sources are newer than the built _rocisa.so — bindings are stale.
  Modified: .../shared/stinkytofu/src/ir/asm/Function.cpp
  Rebuild:  cmake --build <build_dir> --target _rocisa
```

**3. Build with CMake (Custom Location) and Run Test with Path Flag**

This workflow is for when you need to build the client in a location other than the default
`build_tmp` directory. The `--prebuilt-client` flag is then used to specify this custom path when
running a test. Be sure to pass the root directory of the hipblaslt project when configuring.

```
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite

# install rocisa (once after cloning)
invoke rocisa

# configure in a custom directory (e.g., my-custom-build)
cmake --preset tensilelite -S .. -B my-custom-build

# build
cmake --build my-custom-build --parallel

# run a test directly
Tensile/bin/Tensile Tensile/Tests/pre_checkin/<test>.yaml tensile-out \
                           --prebuilt-client=my-custom-build/tensilelite-client/tensilelite-client
```

**4. Build with tox (Custom Build Args)**

This workflow uses `tox` with custom CMake arguments, which is useful for creating
specialized builds (e.g., Debug builds) and setting the architecture.

```
# build the client using tox with custom CMake flags
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite
TENSILELITE_CLIENT_ARGS="--build-type Debug --gpu-targets gfx90a --clean" tox -e py3 -- Tensile/Tests -m common

# run tests with a single pytest worker (useful for debugging)
TENSILE_NUM_PYTEST_WORKERS=1 tox -e py3 -- Tensile/Tests -m common
```

`invoke build-client` follows the existing `tensilelite` CMake preset by default.
In this repo, that means `/opt/rocm` compiler settings come from the preset, and
`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` and `HIPBLASLT_BUNDLE_PYTHON_DEPS` are already enabled
by default.

Use these flags when you want to override or make that behavior explicit:

* `--rocm-path <path>`: Override the compiler toolchain to use `<path>/bin/amdclang` and `<path>/bin/amdclang++`
* `--export-compile-commands`: Explicitly force `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`
* `--bundle-python-deps`: Explicitly force `HIPBLASLT_BUNDLE_PYTHON_DEPS=ON`
* `--enable-rocprof`: Sets `TENSILELITE_CLIENT_ENABLE_ROCPROFSDK=ON`

### Speeding Up Builds with ccache

Install ccache to cache compiled objects across rebuilds:

```bash
sudo apt install ccache    # Ubuntu/Debian
```

`invoke rocisa` and `invoke build-client` will detect ccache automatically
and use it as the compiler launcher. No additional configuration is needed.

### Environment Variables

* `TENSILE_NUM_PYTEST_WORKERS`: Number of parallel pytest workers used by tox (default: `4`)
* `TENSILELITE_CLIENT_ARGS`: Additional arguments passed to `invoke build-client` during tox runs

### Options

* `TENSILELITE_ENABLE_HOST`: Enables generation of tensilelite host (default: `ON`)
* `TENSILELITE_ENABLE_CLIENT`: Enables generation of tensilelite client application (default: `ON`)
* `TENSILELITE_ENABLE_AUTOBUILD`: Generate wrapper scripts (e.g. `Tensile.sh`) for the cmake build tree. **Deprecated** — run `Tensile/bin/Tensile` directly instead (default: `OFF`)
* `TENSILELITE_BUILD_TESTING`: Build tensilelite host library tests (default: `OFF`)
* `GPU_TARGETS:` Semicolon separated list of gfx targets to build

## How to Rebuild Object Codes Directly from Assembly

During the tuning process, it is of interest to modify an assembly file/s and rebuild the corresponding object file/s and then relink the corresponding co file. Currently, we generate additional source files and a script to provide this workflow.

A new `Makefile` is added that manages rebuilding a co file during iterative development when tuning. One modifies an assembly file of interest, then runs `make` and make will detect what file/s changed and rebuild accordingly.

Assumptions:

- Each problem directory contains a library directory with one co file corresponding to one architecture

**Edit**(2025/3/31) ``rocisa`` use the CMake build system instead of the ``virtualenv``. The behavior of the TensileLite changed a bit with only one extra line.

Example:

```cmake -DTENSILE_BIN=Tensile -DDEVELOP_MODE=ON -S <path-to-tensilelite-root> -B <tensile-out>```

The script will be created in the build folder and will be named in Tensile.bat or Tensile.sh depending on the platform. Then you can then run the script under the ``tensile-out`` folder as usual:

> **Deprecated:** `Tensile.sh` / `Tensile.bat` will be removed in a future release.
> Run `Tensile/bin/Tensile` directly instead.

```
Tensile.sh <abs-path>/Tensile/Tests/gemm/fp16_use_e.yaml tensile-out
```

or

```
Tensile.bat <abs-path>/Tensile/Tests/gemm/fp16_use_e.yaml tensile-out
```

**You don't need to rerun CMake unless you delete the ``tensile-out`` folder.**

To build asm only:

```
# modify an assembly file in tensile-out/1_BenchmarkProblems/Cijk_Ailk_Bjlk_DB_UserArgs_00/00_Final/source/build_tmp/SOURCE/assembly
make co TENSILE_OUT=tensile-out
# re-run the client
```

The Makefile will set the target based on the name of the co file and sets a default wavefront flag but each of these can be customized as follows:

For 64 wavefront size systems,

```
make co TENSILE_OUT=tensile-out ARCH="gfx942" WAVE=64
```

For 32 wavefront size systems,

```
make co TENSILE_OUT=tensile-out ARCH="gfx1100" WAVE=32
```

In addition, we provide `ASM_ARGS` and `LINK_ARGS` as additional customization points for the assemble and link step respectively. If the architecture cannot be detect corectly, you may need to manually add ``ARCH="gfx942:xnack-"`` to the ``make`` command.
