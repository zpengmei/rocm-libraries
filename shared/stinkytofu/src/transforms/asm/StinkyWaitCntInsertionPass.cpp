// StinkyWaitCntInsertionPass
//
// Inserts s_wait_* instructions so that asynchronous memory operations complete
// before their results are consumed. Dependencies are resolved by walking
// instruction-level def-use chains (not by tracking individual registers); PHI
// nodes are flattened to their incoming values at lookup time.
//
// The pass covers three independent hardware counters:
//   - DS      (dlcnt)  via s_wait_dscnt
//   - buffer  (vlcnt)  via s_wait_loadcnt
//   - tensor  (tlcnt)  via s_wait_tensorcnt
//
// Only basic blocks approved by PassContext::shouldProcessBasicBlock are
// analyzed and modified; the companion StinkyRemoveWaitCntPass is expected to
// have stripped stale waits beforehand so this pass owns every emitted wait.
//
// High-level flow (matches the "Pass Flow" diagram in the user doc):
//
//   buildUseDefChain          Setup: build instruction-level def-use chains
//                             with PHIs preserved for flattening.
//   Phase 1 buildBlockExitStates
//                             Pre-scan every processed block once; populate
//                             blockExitMemState with the DS / buffer / tensor
//                             ops in flight at each block's exit. The tensor
//                             state is stored as a single collapsed
//                             TensorPath (pred == self) for successor seeding.
//   Phase 2 computeRequiredWaits   (per block, reverse post-order)
//                             Seed ONE TensorPath per non-self CFG
//                             predecessor (preserving per-pred FIFO depth),
//                             walk the block in program order, and produce a
//                             list of (anchor, WaitCountSpec) pairs across
//                             all three counters. Tensor waits run through
//                             planTensorWait, which can record compensating
//                             drains for shallower predecessors. Trims the
//                             refined exit state back into blockExitMemState
//                             for successors (tensor paths collapsed to a
//                             single union view).
//   Phase 3 emitWaitInstructions   (per block, reverse post-order)
//                             Insert one s_wait_* IR node per non-kUnused
//                             field in each WaitCountSpec, immediately before
//                             the anchor.
//   Phase 3.5 emitTailTensorCompensations  (after the RPO walk)
//                             For every (predBlock, predRelativeWait)
//                             recorded by planTensorWait's correctives,
//                             insert an s_wait_tensorcnt at the
//                             predecessor's tail (before its terminator)
//                             so the shallower path drains its dep before
//                             the merge anchor sees it.
//   Phase 4 removePHIs        Strip PHI pseudo-instructions from processed
//                             blocks now that def-use chains have been
//                             consumed.
//
// For the full algorithm walk-through (per-instruction logic, redundancy
// elision, cross-block seeding, MemTokenData conservative fallbacks, etc.)
