/**
 * @brief Expands composite IR instructions based on architecture capabilities
 *
 * Composite instructions are high-level operations that may map to:
 * - Single instruction if architecture supports it (e.g., v_pk_add_f32)
 * - Multiple instructions if architecture doesn't support it (e.g., 2x v_add_f32)
 *
 * Examples:
 * - VAddPKF32:
 *   - gfx9+: Single v_pk_add_f32 instruction
 *   - Fallback: Two v_add_f32 instructions (low/high)
 *
 * - VMovB64:
 *   - If supported: Single v_mov_b64 instruction
 *   - Fallback: Two v_mov_b32 instructions
 *
 * - VLShiftLeftOrB32:
 *   - If supported: Single v_lshl_or_b32 instruction
 *   - Fallback: v_lshlrev_b32 + v_or_b32
 *
 * - SAddU64:
 *   - If supported: Single s_add_u64 instruction
 *   - Fallback: s_add_u32 + s_addc_u32 (carry via SCC)
 *
 * - VAddNCU64:
 *   - If supported: Single v_add_nc_u64 instruction
 *   - Fallback: v_add_co_u32 + v_add_co_ci_u32 (carry via VCC)
 *
 * - VAddLShiftLeftU32:
 *   - If supported: Single v_add_lshl_u32 instruction
 *   - Fallback: v_add_u32 + v_lshlrev_b32
 *
 * - VLShiftLeftAddU32:
 *   - If supported: Single v_lshl_add_u32 instruction
 *   - Fallback: v_lshlrev_b32 + v_add_u32
 *
 * This pass runs BEFORE ToStinkyAsmPass and operates on IRList,
 * expanding composite instructions in-place.
 *
 * Now uses unified Pass infrastructure:
 * - Operates on Function -> BasicBlock -> IRList
 * - Works with raw LogicalInstruction* pointers
 * - Integrates with PassManager
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```cpp
 * PassManager pm;
 * pm.addPass(createCompositeInstructionLoweringPass());
 * pm.addPass(createToStinkyAsmPass());
 * pm.run();
 * ```
