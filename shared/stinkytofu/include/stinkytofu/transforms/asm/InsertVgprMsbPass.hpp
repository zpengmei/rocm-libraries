/// For architectures with HasVgprMSB (e.g. gfx1250), VGPRs above index 255 require
/// the hardware VGPR_OFF register to be configured via s_set_vgpr_msb. This pass
/// scans instructions, computes the required MSB value per operand slot, and inserts
/// s_set_vgpr_msb when the required value differs from the current state.

/// After a label (branch target), the pass conservatively resets MSB state and
/// inserts an s_nop before s_set_vgpr_msb to satisfy hardware constraints.
