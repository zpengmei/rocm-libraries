"""Torch tensor launcher for CK DSL HSACO kernels.

This runtime is for integrations like AITER where tensors already live on the
GPU. It avoids host staging: kernel arguments are packed from
`torch.Tensor.data_ptr()` and Python scalar values, then launched through the

    When the caller passes ``stream=0`` (or ``None``), we substitute

    essential for correctness: workspace tensors are allocated by
    ``torch.empty(..., device=q.device)`` which records the
    allocation against torch's current stream. The torch caching
    allocator's stream-aware free queues a release event on *that*
    stream when the Python reference count drops. If we then launch on
    the literal HIP null stream (handle ``0``), the allocator never
    sees our launch and may hand the workspace memory to the next
    ``torch.empty`` *while our kernel is still writing to it*. Matching
    the launch stream to the allocation stream makes the standard
    FIFO single-stream ordering correctness rules apply, exactly the
    way Triton and AITER's paged-attention shim do it.

    Torch-optional: callers that don't use torch tensors (e.g. the
    numpy ``run_manifest`` runner) can pass ``stream=0`` and we will
    return ``0`` -- there's no torch caching allocator to be racing
    against, so the legacy HIP null stream is fine.
